## Getting Started

- Ensure that python3 is installed and available in your path
    - It's recommended to use the `pyvenv` utility to manage dependencies separately from other projects.
    - To do this make a folder anywhere on your system to house the environment (I recommend something like `~/syndication_venv`) and run `pyvenv PATH_TO_ENVIRONMENT`

- Install dependencies
    - In the project root run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
        -This will install all dependencies in the folder you configured in the previous step

- Run the app
    - In the project root, run `python3 manage.py runserver`
