Long Island City Event Syndication


# Long Island City Event Syndication

## Getting Started

- Ensure that python 2 is installed and available in your path
    - It's recommended to use the `pyvenv` utility to manage dependencies separately from other projects.
    - To do this make a folder anywhere on your system to house the environment (I recommend something like `~/syndication_venv`) and run `pyvenv PATH_TO_ENVIRONMENT`

- Install dependencies
    - In the project root run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
        -This will install all dependencies in the folder you configured in the previous step

- Run the app
    - In the project root, run `python manage.py runserver`
    - Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/eventsyndication/ to see the homepage. This is just a starter point for now. Possibly merge some code with Stas's branch?
